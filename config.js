        story: "After nearly a decade working as a journalist, my career came to an abrupt halt due to uncontrollable circumstances. I lost my job ‚Äî but refused to lose momentum. Instead, I chose to rebuild ‚Äî from scratch. I pivoted into tech, enrolling in a full-stack web development bootcamp at George Washington University, where I discovered my passion for cloud computing.",
        experience: "I currently have 2.5 years of full-time experience, in addition to 1.5 years of internships across cloud computing, data engineering, and web development.",
        philosophy: "Every line of code I write carries the same determination that fueled my transformation. I don't just build systems ‚Äî I build second chances."
